### Some thoughts about the Implementation
As all we need to show the data in different styles, I decided to implement all the data manipulation in the front-end side in order to to send to many request to the database. As it was required not to use any already made library I used jQuery and wrote all the logic by my self. For simplicity I putted everything in just one `html` file. For sure, this is not the best wat possible. Please don't judge too strict, this was done with very quick hand.
